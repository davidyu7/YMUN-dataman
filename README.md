Users's Guide to YMUN Data Management Project

The YMUN Registration and Data Management Platform is a website and applicatioin created by David Yu, Emily Mayo, and Claire Calkins in CS50, as a
practical program to be used during the Yale Model United Nations Conference, a MUN conference that attracts and hosts about 200 high school
teachers and students every year. This application/website will serve as a data management and organization system for that conference.

Background:

As stated in the Introduction, this website has the goal of serving as a data management tool for the Yale Model United Nations conference, a MUN
conference that takes place in January every year, at Yale. Historically, the YMUN team has used google sheets (or excel sheets) to manage and
keep track of necessary data. However, this system has proven to often be unorganized, subject to human error, and difficult to use. During the
conference, the team usually has one excel sheet to track each of the 39 committees at the conference, one excel sheet to track registration
and advisor information, another excel sheet to track room locations for each committee for each of the four days of the conference, etc. Creating
a website for integrated data management of the information previously located in many different places will allow for optimization of efficiency
during the conference, allowing us to keep better track of our data, and allowing for easier access and use of essential information for the YMUN
team.
